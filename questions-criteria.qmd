These questions are designed to help data rescue partners evaluate requests and offers from data holders and hosts and determine if they are a good fit for a project. The questions are meant to be value neutral and support rapid evaluations. Groups should expand and remix this question list based on their expertise and capacity, as well as the specifics of the data. This material is CC0 licensed.
