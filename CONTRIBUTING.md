## Contributing

add some background here

### How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling
mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to
introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1. If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material,
   you can submit a pull request (PR). 

### Where to Contribute

1. If you wish to change this content, add issues and pull requests here.


### What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing new content to updating 
existing text.

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we are
smarter together than we are on our own. 

### What *Not* to Contribute

TBD

### Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to
Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute]. In brief, we
use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:

1. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each
   significant change.
2. Commit the change in that branch.
3. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
4. Submit a pull request from that branch to the [upstream repository][repo].
5. If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your
   branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.
